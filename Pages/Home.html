			<p>Brandon Sanderson (born December 19, 1975) is an American fantasy and science fiction writer.
				He is best known for the Cosmere universe, in which most of his fantasy novels (most notably
				the Mistborn series and The Stormlight Archive) are set. He is also known for finishing Robert
				Jordan's epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time. Sanderson was raised in Lincoln, Nebraska
				before attending Brigham Young University, where he received degrees in English literature
				and creative writing. He created Sanderson's Laws of Magic and popularized the terms hard
				magic and soft magic systems. In 2008 Sanderson started a podcast with author Dan Wells and
				cartoonist Howard Tayler called Writing Excuses, involving topics about creating genre
				writing and webcomics. In 2016, the American media company DMG Entertainment licensed the
				movie rights to Sanderson's entire Cosmere universe.</p>
