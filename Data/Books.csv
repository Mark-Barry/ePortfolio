Mistborn,The Final Empire,Book 1,17/07/2006,../Resources/Images/SVG/The_Final_Empire.SVG,0765350386,For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler- the Sliver of Infinity- reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror- divinely invincible. Then- when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained- a terribly scarred- heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Rulers most hellish prison. Kelsier snapped and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader- he turned his talents to the ultimate caper- with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworlds elite- the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers- each of whom shares one of his many powers- and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream- not just the greatest heist in history- but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled- Kels plan looks more like the ultimate long shot- until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him- shes a half-Skaa orphan- but shes lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets- and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust- if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?
Mistborn,The Well of Ascension,Book 2,03/06/2008,../Resources/Images/SVG/The_Well_Of_Ascension.SVG,0765356139,The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler -- the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years -- has been vanquished. But Kelsier- the hero who masterminded that triumph- is dead too- and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé- Vin- the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land- and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion- a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying- the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died- and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her. Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp- but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel- the largest city of the former empire- doesn't run itself- and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew- who lead the revolution- must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies – one of them composed of ferocious giants – now vying to conquer the city- and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium- the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.
Mistborn,The Hero Of Ages,Book 3,07/10/2014,../Resources/Images/SVG/The_Hero_Of_Ages.SVG,0765377152,Who is the Hero of Ages? To end the Final Empire and restore freedom; Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result- the Deepness--the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists--is back- along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed. Having escaped death at the climax of The Well of Ascension only by becoming a Mistborn himself- Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world- and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend lest Ruin learn their plans!
Stormlight Archives,The Way of Kings,Book 1,24/05/2011,../Resources/Images/SVG/The_Way_Of_Kings.SVG,0765365278,Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells- trees pull in branches- and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant- but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them- and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There- Kaladin- who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother- has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense- where ten armies fight separately against a single foe- he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother- the late king- he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant- he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean- an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic- Dalinar's niece- Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning- Shallans motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft- her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning- writing, and world-building- The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive- a bold masterpiece in the making.
Stormlight Archives,Words Of Radiance,Book 2,03/03/2015,../Resources/Images/SVG/Words_Of_Radiance.SVG,0765365286,Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave- Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards- a controversial first for a low-status darkeyes. Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin- all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren- Syl. The Assassin- Szeth- is active again- murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar- using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar- widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough- but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives. Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge- she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains- but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. Meanwhile- at the heart of the Shattered Plains- the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks- their numbers ever shrinking- they are convinced by their war leader- Eshonai- to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike- indeed- for Roshar itself- are as dangerous as they are incalculable.
